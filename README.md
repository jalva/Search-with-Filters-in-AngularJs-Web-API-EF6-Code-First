# Web-API-and-AngularJs-Search-with-Filters
Example Web API using EF6 Code First with Sql Server Compact and AngularJs with search filters.

This is a skeleton for a search app using search filters where each filter term contains a count of items available. EF6 Code First creates the database in the App_Data folder, and seeds it with some sample data.
The AngularJs filtering logic is data schema-agnostic and lends itself easily to any type of data with minimal effort.
